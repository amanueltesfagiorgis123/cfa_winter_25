# Exercise 1: Make a new comment
# Hi my name is Amanuel 

# Exercise 2: Create 5 variables
# Hint: you can try values that are just numbers too, 
# but you don't need to put quotes around them, for example: var = 10
my_name = "Amanuel"
my_age = 22
my_city = "seattle"
my_interest = "IT"
my_hobbbie = "Travel" 





# Exercise 3: print all 5 variables
print(my_name)
print(my_age)
print(my_city)
print(my_hobbbie)
print(my_interest)

# Exercise 4: Try commenting out some of your code, what happens?

# Exercise 5: Make sure all of your code works, revert changes if necessary.
